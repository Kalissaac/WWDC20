 # Ballot Assistant
 Welcome to your very own ballot assistant. This program is designed to make it as easy as possible to make your choices for this election.
 
 You will be presented with a series of questions to allow the app to get a sense of what your beliefs are. Once you complete it, your ballot will be presented to you. You can always modify the choices made if you don't agree with them.
 (For the purposes of this demonstration, the app uses data from the March 3, 2020 Presidential Primary election.)
 
 When ready, you can uncomment the line below:
