# Ballot Assistant
This project was my submission for the WWDC 2020 Swift Student Challenge. It's a program which aims to improve voter turnout by helping people make decisions on the ballot.

---

When first opening the app, you go through a selection of screens which determine your political preferences, which will generate a hidden score that identifies where you land on the political scale.

Then you select your state and city to identify applicable measures and races.

Once all of the information is gathered, the app will generate a ballot that it thinks aligns closely to your values. It cross references the score given to each candidate or measure with your own score and determines if they match up.

Finally, all of this information is presented to you for easy voting. You can get more in-depth information about each item on the ballot, as well as manually override a decision if you don't agree with it.

This program is designed for people who may not have the time needed to research every single item but still want to contribute to their country. Therefore, it can be completed whenever you have a couple minutes, such as when waiting in line or in the parking lot.

*The demo only contains basic information for the March 3, 2020 primary election, as it's currently more of a proof of concept.*
